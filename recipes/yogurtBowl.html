     <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> This is a high protein recipe perfect for your weight loss and muscle growth goals. It's approximately 300 calories with 30g of protein. It's been a staple on my aggressive cut of 1400 calories and will keep those sweet cravings away. It's super quick and easy with easy ingredient substitutions for normal yogurt. You can adjust by using different ingredients types like the protein, yogurt, and toppings to your liking, but hopefully still hitting your macros.</p>
