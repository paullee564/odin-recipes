     <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> This is a high protein recipe perfect for your weight loss and muscle growth goals. It's approximately 500 calories with 120g of protein. It's been a staple on my aggressive cut of 1400 calories and will keep you satiated. It's super quick and easy with easy and you can put it into containers for meal prep. You can adjust by using different ingredients types like the protein, cheese, and sauce to your liking, but hopefully still hitting your macros.</p>
